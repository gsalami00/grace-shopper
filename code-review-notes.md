- Think about cart vs completed orders
  - How you deal with price changes, for example
- Landing page?
- Might want to move the 'update quantity' to the 'put' route (and use findOrCreate method)
- Move api keys to secrets file
- Security
  - Public vs protected routes (Gatekeeper middleware in routes)
  - req.user vs req.body.userID
